## 2025-02-18 - [Parallelize Independent API Calls]
**Learning:** `find_example_traces` was performing 3 sequential Cloud Trace API calls to gather different types of traces (slow, recent, errors). These are independent and can be parallelized using `asyncio.gather` for significant latency reduction.
**Action:** Always check for independent `await` calls in async functions and use `asyncio.gather` where possible.
