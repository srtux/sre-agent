### Trust & Safety
- **Read-Only by Default**: The agent primarily reads telemetry.
- **Auditing**: Every command executed is logged in your GCP project's Audit Logs.
- **No Persistence**: The agent does not store your telemetry data; it only analyzes it in context.
- **Approval Required**: Destructive or costly actions always require explicit user consent.
